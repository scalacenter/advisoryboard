# The Scala Center Advisory Board

## Purpose

This repository documents the process and activities of the [Scala
Center](http://scala.epfl.ch) Advisory Board, the body which makes
recommendations on the activities of the Scala Center, under the provisions of
the [Scala Industry Affiliates
Program](https://scala.epfl.ch/docs/ScalaCenterMembershipRegulations.pdf)

## Proposals for Recommendation

Proposals for recommendation may be submitted to the Advisory Board for
consideration only by

 - The Scala Center,
 - advisory board members,
 - affiliate members, or
 - community members,

and should be made via a pull-request adding a new Markdown file to the
[proposals](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/tree/master/proposals)
directory.  The proposal should be assigned the next available Scala Center
Proposal (SCP) number in sequence, and the file should be named
`nnn-<description>.md`, where `nnn` is the SCP number, padded with zeroes, and
`<description>` is a concise, lower-case, dash-separated description of the
proposal.

Proposals should follow the format and sections laid out in the [template
proposal](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/tree/master/templates/proposal.md),
and should be concise enough to fit on a single side of paper if printed out.

## Recommendations

Once a proposal has been adopted by the Advisory Board, it will become a
recommendation, and should be copied, noting any amendments, into the
[recommendations](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/tree/master/recommendations)
directory.

## Invitations

For reference, invitations sent to each Advisory Board representative are
included in the 
[invitations](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/tree/master/invitations)
directory.

## Agendas

Agendas for each Advisory Board meeting shall be made available online at least
five days before the meeting takes place, and shall reside in the
[agendas](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/tree/master/agendas)
directory, using the same naming scheme as the minutes.

## Minutes

The minutes of the Scala Center shall be written up by the secretary after each
meeting, and made available shortly afterwards in the
[minutes](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/tree/master/minutes)
directory, under the filename `xxx-yyyy-qz.md`, where `xxx` represents the
meeting number, `yyyy` represents the year and `z` represents the quarter (1,
2, 3 or 4).

## Contributions

Contributions *may* be made to this repository, however the documents here
represent a record of the proceedings of Advisory Board meetings, so only
immaterial changes such as spelling corrections and reformatting will be
accepted.
