Dear board members,

It's time to decide when to have our next board meeting, which I believe will be our 18th edition. I hope we'll find a date between 16-29 Oct that works well for everyone!

Please use this Doodle to vote for a date for the meeting:

Please submit and review proposals soon, and consider notifying this list:

I'd like to call your attention to Daniela's proposal around inclusive language (Daniela replaces James for Morgan Stanley -- welcome!).

cheers,
adriaan

Dear board members,

It looks like we have a date that works for everyone: Wed Oct 28, 17:00 - 19:00 (Lausanne time). We'll use Zoom for the meeting. I'll send out a separate invite closer to the date.

Please send any proposals as soon as possible so that we have enough time to discuss beforehand. I propose we set the deadline for proposal submission to Oct 21.

cheers,
adriaan
